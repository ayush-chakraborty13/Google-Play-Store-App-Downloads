# **Results, outcomes and findings**
Both Regression and Classification Models were built and compared. Regression Models performed better as compared to Classification Models.  Random Forest Regressor & Gradient Boost Regressor gave the highest R-Squared value which was further improved by performing hyperparameter tuning. For Classification Models , Random Forest Classifier was chosen for Hyper prameter tuning.

Post Hyper parameter tuning, the R Squared score of Random Forest Regressor was 0.927 and Gradient Boost Regressor was 0.93.

Accuracy score post Hyper parameter tuning of Random Forest Classifier was 0.82.
